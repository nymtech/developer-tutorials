# Nym Developer Tutorials Code
Repo storing the code used in the Nym developer tutorials, which can be found on the [Developer Portal](https://nymtech.net/developers).

This repo contains the following:
- `rust`
	- [`chain query service`](): part one of a two part tutorial on interacting with a Cosmos SDK blockchain via the Rust SDK. Build a service and use it to privately query the Sandbox testnet for account information in preparation of part two - creating a bandwidth credential.

- `typescript`
	- [`simple service provider`](https://nymtech.net/developers/tutorials/simple-service-provider.html): see how the basic structure of a client and service passing messages through the mixnet can be set up.

Each directory contains its own readme and instructions.
